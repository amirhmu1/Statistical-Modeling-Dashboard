probability/statistics
Got it üëç You want me to carefully restate this probability/statistics exercise fully in English. Here‚Äôs a clean, complete version of the problem statement:

---

**Problem Statement (in English):**

Let (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) be independent and identically distributed random variables with common distribution function (F(x)). Let (Y) be another random variable, independent of the (X_i), with distribution function (G(y)).

Define
[
T = \max{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n}, \quad U = \min{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n}.
]

1. Find the distribution function and density function of (T).
2. Find the distribution function and density function of (U).
3. (If needed) Discuss the joint distribution of ((U, T)).

---

Do you also want me to **solve it step by step** (derive the distributions and densities for (T) and (U)) or just provide the **English statement** of the exercise?
