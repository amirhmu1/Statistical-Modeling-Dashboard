Statistical Modeling Dashboard for Sensor Network Load Analysis
Overview

This project provides an interactive statistical modeling dashboard designed to analyze the maximum and minimum load in a network of sensors with an additional central sensor.
Independent random variables 

Features

Parameter Configuration
Define distributions 
F(x) and 
G(y), number of sensors 
n, and other statistical settings through an intuitive interface.
Algorithm Flexibility
Choose from a range of statistical and engineering algorithms to evaluate the network load problem.
Data-Driven Analysis
Support for real data input and simulation modes.
Visualizations
Generate a variety of plots and charts (PDFs, CDFs, joint probability heatmaps, etc.) to better understand the model.
Modular Design
Easy to extend with new algorithms, visualizations, or sensor models.
