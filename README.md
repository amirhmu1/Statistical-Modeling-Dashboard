probability/statistics
Got it 👍 You want me to carefully restate this probability/statistics exercise fully in English. Here’s a clean, complete version of the problem statement:

**Problem Statement (in English):**

Let (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n) be independent and identically distributed random variables with common distribution function (F(x)). Let (Y) be another random variable, independent of the (X_i), with distribution function (G(y)).

Define
[
T = \max{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n}, \quad U = \min{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n}.
]

1. Find the distribution function and density function of (T).
2. Find the distribution function and density function of (U).
3. (If needed) Discuss the joint distribution of ((U, T)).

Great — here’s a complete, step-by-step solution in English for the order-statistic problem. I’ll treat the (X_i) as i.i.d. with CDF (F(x)) and (when needed) PDF (f(x)=F'(x)). I’ll give the results for the continuous/differentiable case (PDF exists) and note the CDF-only versions where appropriate.

# Problem

Let (X_1,\dots,X_n) be i.i.d. with common distribution function (F(x)). Define
[
T=\max{X_1,\dots,X_n},\qquad U=\min{X_1,\dots,X_n}.
]
Find the distribution function and density of (T) and (U). Also give the joint distribution/density of ((U,T)).

# 1. Distribution of (T=\max(X_1,\dots,X_n))

**CDF.** For any real (t),
[
F_T(t)=\Pr(T\le t)=\Pr(X_1\le t,\dots,X_n\le t).
]
Because the (X_i) are independent,
[
F_T(t)=\prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(X_i\le t)=\bigl(F(t)\bigr)^n.
]

**PDF (continuous case).** If (F) is differentiable with density (f), differentiate:
[
f_T(t)=\frac{d}{dt}F_T(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\bigl(F(t)^n\bigr)=n,F(t)^{,n-1}f(t).
]

---

# 2. Distribution of (U=\min(X_1,\dots,X_n))

**CDF.** For any real (u),
[
F_U(u)=\Pr(U\le u)=1-\Pr(U>u)=1-\Pr(X_1>u,\dots,X_n>u).
]
By independence,
[
F_U(u)=1-\prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(X_i>u)=1-\bigl(1-F(u)\bigr)^n.
]

**PDF (continuous case).** Differentiate:
[
f_U(u)=\frac{d}{du}F_U(u)=\frac{d}{du}\bigl(1-(1-F(u))^n\bigr)
= n\bigl(1-F(u)\bigr)^{,n-1}f(u).
]

# 3. Joint distribution / joint density of ((U,T)=(X_{(1)},X_{(n)}))

Consider (u<t). For continuous distributions (no ties with probability 1):

**Joint PDF.** The joint density of the minimum (U) at (u) and the maximum (T) at (t) is
[
f_{U,T}(u,t)=n(n-1),f(u),f(t),\bigl[F(t)-F(u)\bigr]^{,n-2},\qquad u<t.
]

**Derivation (brief):**

* Choose which sample attains the minimum and which attains the maximum: (n(n-1)) ordered choices.
* The chosen minimum has density (f(u)), the chosen maximum has density (f(t)).
* Each of the remaining (n-2) observations must fall in the interval ((u,t)); the probability density contribution for each is (F(t)-F(u)). Multiplying these gives ([F(t)-F(u)]^{n-2}).
* Multiply factors and you get the formula above.

**Support:** (f_{U,T}(u,t)=0) when (u\ge t). (For discrete or mixed distributions, there is positive probability of ties and the continuous joint density formula must be adapted.)

**Check (marginals):** Integrating (f_{U,T}(u,t)) in the appropriate variable recovers (f_U) and (f_T).

# 4. Special case (n=2)

It’s instructive to check (n=2).

* (F_T(t)=F(t)^2,; f_T(t)=2F(t)f(t)).
* (F_U(u)=1-(1-F(u))^2=2F(u)-F(u)^2,; f_U(u)=2(1-F(u))f(u)).
* Joint pdf for (u<t): (f_{U,T}(u,t)=2\cdot1\cdot f(u)f(t)[F(t)-F(u)]^{0}=2f(u)f(t)). (Which matches the fact that for two independent continuous variables the joint density of min and max is simply (2f(u)f(t)) on (u<t).)

---

# 5. Remarks for non-continuous distributions

* If (F) has mass points (discrete components), the formulae for the CDFs (F_T(t)=F(t)^n) and (F_U(u)=1-(1-F(u))^n) still hold.
* The PDF formulae require (F) to be absolutely continuous (i.e., have a density). For mixed or purely discrete distributions, replace derivatives by differences and consider probability masses for ties (events where two or more (X_i) are equal) — then the order-statistics have point-mass probabilities that must be computed combinatorially.

# Final compact formulas (continuous case)

[
\boxed{F_T(t)=F(t)^n,\quad f_T(t)=nF(t)^{,n-1}f(t)}
]
[
\boxed{F_U(u)=1-(1-F(u))^n,\quad f_U(u)=n(1-F(u))^{,n-1}f(u)}
]
[
\boxed{f_{U,T}(u,t)=n(n-1)f(u)f(t)\bigl[F(t)-F(u)\bigr]^{,n-2},\quad u<t}
]
